# README checklist

[checklist.md](checklist.md) is a checklist to help you write a README file
that helps readers feel confident about your project. If you write a README by
following the checklist, then your readers may more easily identify, evaluate,
use, and engage with your project.


For more about how this checklist was created and its use, see the talk I gave
at [Write the Docs NA 2016](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/),
*[Write the Readable README](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dAK42B7qtw)*.


## How to use the checklist

This checklist is a *READ-DO* checklist. If you're starting a new README file,
follow the checklist like a recipe, reading each step and completing it, in
order. Alternatively, if you've already started a README file, you may find it
useful to treat the checklist as a *DO-CONFIRM* checklist, confirming that your
README matches the elements of the checklist after you've finished writing.

With a few exceptions, the checklist is agnostic about what order things appear
in your README or even what kind of project you're documenting. Your README may
cover other topics not covered by this checklist; the checklist covers only
those topics I found to be essential for README files.
